Repository for source control for NASA Psyche Copper Class Team 06a: Hollow Cathode Visualization - Unity WebGL Build

Hello there, and welcome to the repository for the NASA Psyche Copper Class Team 06a: Hollow Cathode Visualization!

This project was developed by Travis Andring, Jacob Blackstone, Patrick Chu, Caleb Jaramillo, Andrew Lies, and Jacob Lyons for Cassie Bowman and Dr. Jason Frieman.

This repository contains a WebGL build developed in Unity 2021.2.8f1, and is displayed as a part of the site made in this repository: https://github.com/astronomicalRedwoods27/hollow_cathode_vis_site

The Unity WebGL Build  is comprised as follows:

To update the text of the text boxes, complete the following tasks:
1. Create the text using the presentation software of your choice, using #c57e0d as the background color, back as the text, and include a small gray border. Type in the desired text, resize it to fit, and use your machine's screen capture tool to create an image of that text box. 
2. Once the sprites are created, upload the image file to the Unity project under the Assets/Sprites/Textboxes. 
3. In the inspector for the new image, change the Texture Type to Sprite (2D and UI).
4. Then, navigate to the desired scene, find the textbox object, and replace the current Textbox sprite with your updated sprite.
5. Run the game in Unity to make sure the text is updated, then build the project again.

The new WebGL Build will need to be re-uploaded to the servers.
